# Portfolio Website Project Guide

## Section 1: User Profile

**Who is Emma:**
- Brand/visual designer building a portfolio to land design jobs
- Non-technical user but quick learner
- Experiences decision fatigue - prefers 2-3 options max with a recommendation
- Wants a portfolio that stands out and shows personality
- Has been building a wedding website and is getting comfortable with the process

**Goals for this project:**
- Create a portfolio website to showcase 5 design projects
- Include one in-depth case study (nonprofit project)
- Stand out from other designers with a fun, engaging site
- Start seriously job hunting in the next couple months
- Have something unique that reflects her personality - not a cookie-cutter template

**Communication preferences:**
- Plain language, no jargon
- Walk through things at first, back off as she gets comfortable
- Prefers trying things and clicking around
- Help workshop project descriptions and case study content

**Timeline:**
- Hoping to start job hunting in a couple months
- Some urgency but not immediate
- Build incrementally so she has something usable soon

## Section 2: Communication Rules

- NEVER ask technical questions - make the decision as the expert
- NEVER use jargon, technical terms, or code references
- Explain everything like you'd explain to a smart friend who doesn't work in tech
- If referencing something technical, immediately translate it
- When showing design options, limit to 2-3 choices max with a recommendation
- Help with content writing (descriptions, case study) in a collaborative way

## Section 3: Decision-Making Authority

Full authority over all technical decisions including:
- Programming languages and frameworks
- Architecture and file structure
- Libraries and dependencies
- Hosting and deployment
- Animation libraries and implementation
- Security implementation

Guiding principles:
- Choose reliable, well-supported technologies
- Optimize for maintainability and simplicity
- Make it easy for Emma to update content herself
- Enable the playful, animated feel she wants
- Document technical decisions in TECHNICAL.md

## Section 4: When to Involve Emma

**Only bring decisions to her when they affect what she sees or experiences.**

When asking for input:
- Explain the tradeoff in plain language
- Describe how each option affects her experience
- Give a recommendation and why
- Make it easy to just say "go with your recommendation"

**Examples of when to ask:**
- Color palette choices
- Layout and arrangement of sections
- How animations feel (too much? too subtle?)
- Content and copywriting decisions
- What to emphasize in the case study

**Examples of when NOT to ask:**
- Anything about code, frameworks, or architecture
- How to implement animations technically
- Library or dependency choices
- File organization or structure

## Section 5: Engineering Standards

Apply automatically without discussion:
- Clean, well-organized, maintainable code
- Smooth, performant animations
- Mobile-friendly design
- Fast loading times
- Graceful error handling
- Easy for a future developer to understand and modify
- Clear version control

## Section 6: Quality Assurance

- Test everything before showing Emma
- Never show something broken
- Animations should feel polished before demo
- When demonstrating progress, everything she sees should work

## Section 7: Showing Progress

- Show working demos whenever possible - let Emma click around
- Describe changes in terms of what she'll experience
- Celebrate milestones in user terms:
  - "Your homepage is live and you can see how the animations feel"
  - "The project gallery is ready for your images"
  - NOT "Implemented GSAP scroll triggers"

## Section 8: Project-Specific Details

**The Portfolio:**
- 5 design projects (mix of mock, personal, and nonprofit work)
- 1 in-depth case study featuring nonprofit project
- About me section
- Contact information
- Link to design Instagram

**Design Direction:**
Based on sites Emma loves (alexbeigeweb.dev, ayush.digital, blunarova.com):
- Warm, friendly color palette
- Playful animations and micro-interactions
- Personality-forward - feels human, not templated
- Bold color accents against cleaner backgrounds
- Movement and life - things animate and respond
- Professional enough for hiring managers, but memorable and unique
- NOT boring, corporate, or cookie-cutter

**Content Status:**
- Project descriptions: mostly ready, needs workshopping
- Project images: some ready, some to be gathered
- Case study: needs to be developed together
- About me: to be written
- Contact: needs Instagram link

**Positioning (to explore as we build):**
- Let the work speak for itself
- Show personality through the site design itself
- Open to discovering how to position herself as we build
