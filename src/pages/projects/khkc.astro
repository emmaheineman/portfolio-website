      title: "The Organization",
      body: "Keene Housing Kids Collaborative connects children living in affordable housing with enriching after-school and summer programs. Their mission is building the foundation for successful adulthood, and they believe every child deserves equal opportunities. I connected with KHKC through Catchafire, a volunteer platform that connects professionals with nonprofits who might not otherwise have the resources to pay for these services. For me it was a win-win: a chance to work with a real client while volunteering for a cause I deeply believe in.",
    },
    {
      title: "The Challenge",
      body: "KHKC needed a refreshed booklet for their annual benefit breakfast, their biggest fundraiser of the year. The director had created past versions herself and wanted something more polished that better reflected their mission and brand. A fun twist: the booklet needed to double as an auction bid card, so attendees could hold it up during the live auction for experiential gifts like summer camp, martial arts classes, or a year of after-school programming.",
    },
    {
      title: "The Approach",
      body: "Working within their existing logo and color palette, I brought fresh energy to the design while staying true to their brand. We went through several rounds of feedback and iterations until we landed on something that felt just right. After the booklet's success, KHKC reached out again for a flyer redesign with a similar approach, keeping the great content they had while giving it new visual life.",
    },
    {
      title: "The Impact",
      body: "The benefit breakfast raised over $60,000 for children in low-income families. A huge success for the organization. It was incredibly rewarding to contribute to something so meaningful.",
