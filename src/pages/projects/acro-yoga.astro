      title: "The Challenge",
      body: "Acro Yoga CHS is a growing acrobatic yoga community in Charleston. They lacked a cohesive visual identity and needed branding to unify their social media presence and event communications.",
    },
    {
      title: "The Approach",
      body: "I started with discovery conversations and dove into mood boarding, exploring imagery associated with Charleston. I wanted to capture the colorful energy of the city while incorporating the pineapple, a historic symbol of hospitality that felt perfect for this community-focused group.",
    },
    {
      title: "The Solution",
      body: "The final brand pairs playful, retro-inspired typography with a vibrant coastal color palette. The pineapple mark anchors the logo, nodding to Charleston's heritage while reflecting the welcoming spirit of the community. Multiple logo variations and a custom pattern give flexibility across applications.",
