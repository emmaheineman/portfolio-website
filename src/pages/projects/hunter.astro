      title: "The Challenge",
      body: "When I joined the Office of Education Abroad at CUNY Hunter College, the office had been dormant since COVID. There was no cohesive visual identity in place, and I was regularly asked to create flyers, posters, and Instagram posts without any foundation to build from. I saw an opportunity to change that.",
    },
    {
      title: "The Approach",
      body: "I started fresh, developing a complete visual identity using the university's existing color palette to stay consistent with CUNY Hunter's broader brand. I created a logo, established design guidelines, and built a system of templates that could be applied across all our materials, from campus posters to social media.",
    },
    {
      title: "The Impact",
      body: "Three and a half years later, our materials are instantly recognizable around campus. Faculty, students, and other offices regularly comment that they can spot our flyers and posters and know immediately they're from our office. That recognition is exactly what a strong visual identity should do.",
